"""Parse and rewrite the ``### Field`` sections of a GitHub issue body.

The tracker issue body is a sequence of `### <FieldName>` headings,
each followed by the field's value. This module exposes a pure
parser/replacer so the CLI can run without ever bringing the body
into the agent's context, and so the (numerous) tricky edge cases
can be unit-tested in isolation.

The parser is a small state machine that:

- tracks whether the current line is inside a fenced code block
  (``` ``` ``` or ``` ~~~ ```) so that a literal ``### foo`` line
  inside a shell snippet never false-matches as a heading;
- considers only level-3 ATX headings (``^### <name>$``);
  level-2 (``## ``) and level-4 (``#### ``) headings are passed
  through as content;
- preserves the original body exactly when no changes are needed
  (idempotent rewrite).
